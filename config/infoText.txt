***Welcome to The Auxy Collective***

https://soundcloud.com/auxycollective

• The Auxy Collective is a community sourced initiative designed to allow increased recognition for more based on talent rather than popularity
• The goal is for everybody to be able to nominate and vote on music for the community to view, so that any talented producer can get their music heard.

**How It Works**
• Everybody suggests songs in #repost-suggestions
• Everybody reacts with a :thumbsup: on songs they want to vote for
• Each Sunday, the :three: tracks with the most :thumbsup: will be featured the following week
• Each track gets 2 days in the spotlight (Mon/Tue, Wed/Thur, Fri/Sat)

**Trust Levels**

@Basic - Level 1-4
@Member - Level 5-9
@Regular - Level 10-19
@Leader - Level 20+`
