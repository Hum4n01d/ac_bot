***Welcome to The Auxy Collective***

• This is a community sourced initiative designed to allow increased recognition for more producers within the ever growing Auxy community. 
• The goal is for everybody here to be able to nominate and vote on music for the community to view, so that talented producers that aren't as strong in the promotion game can get their music heard.

**How It Works**
• Suggest songs to be reposted in #repost-suggestions all week and vote for ones you like
• Every Sunday, the :three: tracks with the most :thumbsup: will be featured the following week
• Each track gets 2 days in the spotlight (Mon/Tue, Wed/Thur, Fri/Sat)
